/* Pass by address semantics:
   In golang, variables are passed by pointers just as they are in C-based languages.
   We pass the address of the data as the parameters.
   Essentially, this is pass by value - only difference is that the data being copied and passed is an address
   Pointer variables are used to store addresses.
