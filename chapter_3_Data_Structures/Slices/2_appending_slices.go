	   In this case we don't want to return a nil slice (we'd probably want
	   to return nil on an error). We should return an empty slice.
	   The pointer of an Empty slice points to an Empty Struct - zero-allocation type.
	   We can have a million Empty slices. All of them point to the same 8-byte fixed "Empty Struct"
	   available at runtime.

   In the code above, we know before hand that we're going to insert

   to use make and create a slice of a particular size
   i.e data := make([]string, 0, 1e5)

   If you create the data slice as above , and run the program again,
   you should not see any output. This is because we never ever have to make
   a copy of the backing array to re-initialize to a new larger array
