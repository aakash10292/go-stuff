## Methods

Methods are functions that give data the ability to exhibit behavior.

## Notes

* Methods are functions that declare a receiver variable.
* Receivers bind a method to a type and can use value or pointer semantics.
* Value semantics mean a copy of the value is passed across program boundaries.
* Pointer semantics mean a copy of the values address is passed across program boundaries.
* Stick to a single semantic for a given type and be consistent.

## Quotes

_"Methods are valid when it is practical or reasonable for a piece of data to expose a capability." - William Kennedy_
